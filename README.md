EV-Laundry
==========

        	This web-based app was designed for EV laundry, a local nonprofit company that employs young adults with autism and other developmental disabilities. EV laundry serves residents of Granville Towers, fraternity houses, and other residential communities in Chapel Hill. EV picks up dirty laundry and returns clean, folded laundry within 48 hours. This app was designed to replace EVs paper based system of processing orders and recording items. The system had been in place since the company had begun, and was outdated and inefficient. The sheets were easily misplaced, which caused unnecessary frustration and stress for the employees. It was also tedious to fill out all the parts of the inventory sheet. Our web-based app serves to replace this paper-based system and provides a system of managing orders that is easy and convenient to use, understand and regulate. We were motivated to choose this project because we wanted to implement something we knew would be utilized and helpful and would directly impact a Chapel Hill organization. We wanted to focus on something aimed more on the needs of disabled people in a professional environment rather than entertainment sector as we felt that a majority of the class was pursuing this venue. While this app was designed specifically for EV, it is definitely usable by any similar company. EV has recently been giving tours to people who are interested in replicating the business, and this app will be usable to these people as well.
